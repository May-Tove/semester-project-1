                <p>
                  Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
                  down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why
                  not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our
                  exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make
                  sure you come ready to learn and explore.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
                  Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
                  experiment with our team of experts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you
                  can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
                  Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about
                  the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

                <p>
                  As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
                  places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
                  students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
                  laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite
                  and inspire them.
                </p>
