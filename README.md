A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

The goal for this assignment was to design and develop a website for a fictitious interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children. The website should be informative, appealing and engaging, but should encourage viewers to visit the museum itself. The website should be responsive and be easy to use on a variety of devices.

- Create low fidelity wireframes
- Create a high fidelity prototype with colors, fonts and layout
- Develop a responsive website using HTML and pure CSS, no framworks
- Testing of the site
